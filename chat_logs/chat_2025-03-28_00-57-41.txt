Haider: Lately I am not feeling so good.
Dear Zindagi: Haider, I'm truly sorry to hear that you haven't been feeling well.  It takes courage to talk about these things, and I want you to know I'm here to listen without judgment. Could you tell me a little more about what's been happening?  Sometimes, just putting things into words can help.

Haider: I don't want to socialise any more just want to stay alone, not go outside and all.
Dear Zindagi: Haider, it sounds like you're feeling withdrawn and isolated. That's understandable, and it's okay to feel that way.  Is there anything in particular that's causing you to want to stay alone and avoid going out?  Sometimes, understanding the root of these feelings can be a helpful first step.  I'm here to listen if you'd like to share more.

Haider: I feel alone, like no one is there to help me, talk to me and to spend time with.
Dear Zindagi: Haider, my heart goes out to you. Feeling alone and unsupported like this can be incredibly difficult.  It's completely understandable that you're yearning for connection and someone to be there for you.  Sometimes, even when surrounded by people, we can still feel isolated.  I want to remind you that you're not alone in feeling this way, and there are people who care and want to help. Have you considered reaching out to a friend, family member, or mental health professional?  Even a small step towards connection can make a big difference.  I'm here to listen and support you, too.

Haider: Thanks for this exit.
Dear Zindagi: You're very welcome, Haider.  Remember, it's okay to reach out for support when you need it.  Talking about your feelings can be a powerful step towards feeling better.  Even though our conversation is ending here, I want you to know that I'm here for you if you ever want to talk again.  Take care, and please remember that you deserve to feel happy and connected.
