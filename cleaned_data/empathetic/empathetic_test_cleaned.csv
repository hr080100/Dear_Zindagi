I struggled with it_comma_ but my friend was in a really bad spot_comma_ with no income and raising her grandchild_comma_ he was the financial supporter. So_comma_ I didn't tell her_comma_ as I knew it would really hurt her in several ways_comma_ plus she really loves him!,faithful

i was thinking about it! I wanted to join a group for local moms,lonely
I have a friend that has a child that is unruly and does bad things. One day at our home_comma_ he grabbed a game and sat on it_comma_ instantly breaking it! It was expensive and this really irked me_comma_ especially because she doesn't discipline him when he does bad things.,annoyed
Me either! I have two of my own children_comma_ and I would have never let them get away with that kind of behavior when they were his age. I just don't understand those kind of parents@!,annoyed
I'm so scared of bugs! i found one in my hair yesterday and almost died,terrified
Ugh I hate bugs with a passion_comma_ they are so creepy,terrified
I recently spoke with my ex-girlfriend on the phone. The conversation went pretty well_comma_ and it reminded me of my past experiences with her.,nostalgic
Yes_comma_ they ended somewhat well_comma_ but there were tense moments. I am glad she's doing well_comma_ but I miss her.,nostalgic
Thank you! That means a lot.,nostalgic
One of the times I remember feeling the most blissed out in life was right after the birth of my first child.,content
Obviously there are the demands of a new child -- but that feeling of finally meeting someone you waited so long for_comma_ and the love surrounding the whole situation. Truly something to remember.,content
Have you ever been in a situation when payment of some kind has come through *just* in the nick of time?! Talk about gratitude!,grateful
Absolutely. You go from scared and desperate to grateful and optimistic in one quick moment! It's not a situation I wish to be in again.,grateful
Im so grateful for my family due to an incident with my friend,grateful
My friend lost her parents and siblings in a fire and their family was very close to mine. So seeing her go through the grief made me realize how thankful I should be ,grateful
Yes definitely. Never take anything for granted as you never know when it will be taken away from you,grateful
I'm a big believer in listening to your gut. Sometimes I might wonder where my intuition is leading me_comma_ but it always seems to be spot on.,trusting
"It is a ""knowing"" -- and a flowing! When something is right_comma_ it just feels easier to go with it -- like you're being led_comma_ even if you might not fully know to where.",trusting
I couldnt celebrate my 18th birthday as I had exams during the time and I felt terrible for it. But my friends threw a surprise party for me and it was the best! ,surprised
I was studying in my bedroom for a couple of hours straight with headphones on and then my mom called me to the living room for dinner and when I went out the whole place was decorated and everyone was there,surprised
I feel lonely sometimes cause I live in a house with 5 girls and all of them have boyfriends and sometimes they are all hanging out with their significant others and I feel lonely,lonely
Sometimes they joke about it and obviously I make it look like its totally fine cause I dont want to give them the impression that I am lonely but it does hurt sometimes,lonely
As silly as it sounds_comma_ I was so surprised at how different my two kids were as babies. You're reminded that they're wired with their own personalities from the git-go.,surprised
One was pacifier_comma_ one was fingers. One wanted to co-sleep_comma_ one liked her space. One liked facing *out* in the Baby Bjorn carrier_comma_ one liked cocooning in a sling!,surprised
The other day I had a deep craving for Chik-Fil-A.,disappointed
Mine too. So I drive there and pull in the parking lot and it's completely empty. I then realized it was Sunday.,disappointed
I visited an orphan once and it was such a surreal moment. It made me realise how thankful I should be for a family,grateful
Yes it definitely was. I went with intentions to teach the kid a few things but I ended up learning lots more from him ,grateful
My oldest and my husband have always had a rough relationship. I've got to believe that as she gets older_comma_ it will get better!,hopeful
That's always good to hear. But in the moment -- argh_comma_ my *heart*. How did your mom maneuver the differences between y'all? Did that wear on her?,hopeful
But in the meantime -- the unspoken strain is NOT fun. But I'm glad to hear about a happy ending -- thank you for that!,hopeful
I can still look back with shame at the way I treated a girl in sixth grade. I wasn't as bad as others_comma_ but that doesn't make me feel any better.,ashamed
Well_comma_ like a lot of 6th graders I was aware of *not* wanting to be an outcast for any reason. And unfortunately_comma_ she was. As an adult of course_comma_ my heart squeezes for *all* the kids we were!,ashamed
"Unfortunately_comma_ she died. I only found out when Facebook first came out_comma_ and her brother and I ""friended"" one another.",ashamed
I'm currently working for someone that is *such* a great example of a leader! It makes going into work inspiring every day / every way.,impressed
That's a very kind statement_comma_ and certainly what I would strive for. And it's the rarity that *inspires* me. That should be the norm_comma_ not the exception! THAT'S what I'd like to inspire in people. How about you?,impressed
That is soul-sapping. What do you do to inspire yourself_comma_ and not let that kind of behavior drag you down?,impressed
My friend's baby has grown so much since the last time I had seen her!,surprised
It had been about 8 weeks - I don't get out her way often_comma_ even though we live 30 minutes away.,surprised
Yes!  I got to be 'auntie' for a bit and help change her and get her fed and down for a nap while my friend had a chance to toss laundry in the wash.  It was a good day for everyone!,surprised
Running my first (and maybe only!) marathon felt like *such* a huge accomplishment!,proud
Ah_comma_ it was the best! Plus it helped that I purposely chose an amazing destination in which to run it -- it was the Venice Marathon!,proud
We were living overseas at the times -- the most impressive part was crossing the Grand Canal over a pontoon of boats to finish the marathon ;-),proud
I recently found out that a person I very much intimately admired did not feel the same way for me. I was pretty surprised.,surprised
She just started treating me differently all of a sudden. And now she is going to be moving away soon.,surprised
I'm always appalled when I see bullying in action -- whether it's on a playground or political stage -- not much makes me angrier.,angry
How do you channel the anger? Obviously_comma_ it too easily turns into the same kind of negative emotion I'm upset about -- so that can feel hypocritical!,angry
Are you ever tempted to put anyone's face on the punching bag?! Ha! (Kidding/not kidding!),angry
One morning my mother came to my house to pick my daughter up for school and told me she saw my daughter's cat on the road and he had been hit. I had to tell my daughter about the loss of her beloved pet.,sad
She was around 11_comma_ so she took it very hard. I went ahead and let her stay home from school_comma_ as I knew she wouldn't do well that day.,sad
I was soooo excited to take our kids to Disneyland for the first time!,excited

I find it odd -- and annoying -- when people don't respond to or even acknowledge emails.,annoyed
It would be great if there was a way we could all tell the best way to reach someone -- I know some people prefer texts to emails -- but if you're in a work situation_comma_ how do you ensure communication?,annoyed
I recently had a big argument with my sister. We both got very upset and angry at each other.,angry
I'm not so sure. We just had a discussion that heated and became an argument with tempers flying.,angry
I felt most lonely when we first moved overseas_comma_ my husband then had to travel out of *that* country for business -- AND I had a new baby!,lonely
From Santa Fe to Hong Kong -- ultimately a fantastic adventure. And I ended up with a wonderful group of friends. Expats bond quickly!,lonely
One of the saddest things to me is when people underestimate what they can do and/or are capable of.,sad
That's perfectly natural. You sound like the kind of person_comma_ though_comma_ that quickly regained their bearings. Disappointments like that usually come with some *good* lessons.,sad
Once my husband asked me not to tell my mom that he was busy that day when she needed his help but I told her anyway.  I really felt bad b/c he got pretty upset with me.,ashamed
Yeah thats a good question.  I totally deserved him being mad.  I just felt bad for him b/c he was so busy that day and I didn't want him to have one more thing on his plate I guess,ashamed
There was a back neighbor that called my 10 year old son a ugly name one time_comma_ simply because he entered her yard slightly when he rode around the corner.!,furious

Too often_comma_ it's a health scare that makes us value health. It inspires me to try and do something to keep healthy every day.,grateful

Every time I look through older photos of my children_comma_ I'm taken right back to the time they were that size_comma_ and what we were doing! It's a bittersweet feeling_comma_ for sure.,sentimental
Are your kids adults now?,sentimental
I have an 18 year old as well -- I don't know about you_comma_ but it's hard to consider her an adult sometimes!,sentimental
I have a hard time having confidence in myself but when I got married and I had my hair and makeup done I felt like I was beautiful!  I had so much confidence in myself that day and it was great!,confident
I really try but it's hard to replicate that day for sure.,confident
"My husband and I both work for ourselves -- a blessing and a curse at times_comma_ since it can be tough to determine a ""regular"" income.",anxious
We found a pretty good balance in that I have a part-time job that I *love* -- and that comes with benefits like insurance. That's a big worry addressed_comma_ right there.,anxious
I am sorry_comma_ because I absolutely know that concern. I truly hope you find a resolution to that.,anxious

I am definitely a proud parent of our 15 year old -- she was determined to work this summer_comma_ and even with us saying no one would hire her until 16 -- she found a job!,proud
That_comma_ and she's enjoying the independence of having her own money. Remember that? Making money that you truly could use for your *pleasure* (and not just necessities ?! ;-)),proud
Same! I was surprised 15 year olds *can* actually work during the summer. It's just finding an employer who knows those hours get cut WAY back once school starts.,proud
